## üí° Tips for Customization

- **Modify the Prompt**: You can adjust the prompt in `process-terms.js` to cater to your specific needs. For example:
  - Focus on clauses that involve **financial liability or monetary obligations**.
  - Highlight terms that may **limit user rights or legal recourse**.
  - Emphasize **data collection and sharing practices** that could compromise privacy.
  - Specify **user-friendly language** to ensure non-technical users can understand the summary.

  ### Example Modifications:
  1. To focus on financial concerns:
     ```javascript
     {
       role: "user",
       content: `As a legal expert reviewing a Terms of Use document, identify clauses related to financial liabilities, hidden fees, or payment obligations that could deter users from signing up. Highlight only the clauses with significant financial impact.`
     }
     ```

  2. To emphasize user rights:
     ```javascript
     {
       role: "user",
       content: `As a legal expert reviewing a Terms of Use document, identify sections that excessively limit user rights, including restrictions on account termination, refund policies, or arbitration clauses. Focus on the clauses that may cause the most concern for users.`
     }
     ```

  3. To address privacy concerns:
     ```javascript
     {
       role: "user",
       content: `As a legal expert reviewing a Privacy Policy, identify clauses that involve excessive data collection, invasive tracking methods, or sharing personal data with third parties. Focus on practices that could violate user privacy expectations.`
     }
     ```

- **Experiment and Iterate**: Test different prompts to see what works best for your use case and refine them based on feedback or the type of summaries you need.
